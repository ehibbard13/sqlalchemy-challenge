# sqlalchemy-challenge

Origional files provided by UW Madison. 

I refernced a previous in class challenge, Dow Dates and Pandas Documentation found online. 


First I looked over the provided csv files to see where the the data columns were. I then collected the the SQLite database and reflected the data into classes and saved that information to be used later. 

Once that inforamtion was saved I created a session link and was able to move on to querying. 

I used the provided data to find the most recent date in the data set and then used that date to find a date that was a year earlier. I retireved the precipitation data, dates, ordered them and then created a bar graph. 

After I similarly queried for station count, active stations ordered by count, and the lowest, highest and average temp from the first station. 

I then did another query of the stations and taking the most active station and found the corresponding temperatures and plotted them on a histogram for a year, dividing then into 12 bins for a more organized reading of the information. 

Once all that was done I ended the session.
